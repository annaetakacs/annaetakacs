hiring login an introduction machine learning theory its applications a visual tutorial examples 0 shares marisela ordaz machine learning ml coming growing recognition ml play key role wide range critical applications data mining natural language processing image recognition expert systems ml provides potential solutions domains set pillar future civilization what machine learning so want program predict example traffic patterns busy intersection task t run machine learning algorithm data past traffic patterns experience e successfully learned better predicting future traffic patterns performance measure p among different types ml tasks crucial distinction drawn supervised unsupervised learning we primarily focus supervised learning end article includes brief discussion unsupervised learning links interested pursuing topic supervised machine learning so let say simple predictor form a simple machine learning example we stick simple problems post sake illustration reason ml exists real world problems much complex on flat screen draw picture three dimensional data set ml problems commonly deal data millions dimensions complex predictor functions ml solves problems cannot solved numerical means alone with mind let look simple example say following training data wherein company employees rated satisfaction scale 1 100 first notice data little noisy that see pattern employee satisfaction tends go salary goes fit neatly straight line this always case real world data absolutely want train machine using real world data so train machine perfectly predict employee level satisfaction the answer course the goal ml never make perfect guesses ml deals domains thing the goal make guesses good enough useful if ask predictor satisfaction employee making 60k would predict rating 27 it obvious terrible guess machine know much and repeat process say 1500 times predictor end looking like now getting somewhere a note complexity this function takes input four dimensions variety polynomial terms deriving normal equation function significant challenge many modern machine learning problems take thousands even millions dimensions data build predictions using hundreds coefficients predicting organism genome expressed climate like fifty years examples complex problems fortunately iterative approach taken ml systems much resilient face complexity instead using brute force machine learning system feels way answer for big problems works much better while mean ml solve arbitrarily complex problems make incredibly flexible powerful tool gradient descent minimizing wrongness with least squares penalty bad guess goes quadratically difference guess correct answer acts strict measurement wrongness the cost function computes average penalty training examples consider following plot cost function particular ml problem that covers basic theory underlying majority supervised machine learning systems but basic concepts applied variety different ways depending problem hand classification problems under supervised ml two major subcategories our examples far focused regression problems let also take look classification example in classification regression predictor useful what usually want predictor makes guess somewhere 0 1 in cookie quality classifier prediction 1 would represent confident guess cookie perfect utterly mouthwatering a prediction 0 represents high confidence cookie embarrassment cookie industry values falling within range represent less confidence might design system prediction 0 6 means man tough call i gonna go yes sell cookie value exactly middle 0 5 might represent complete uncertainty this always confidence distributed classifier common design works purposes illustration predictor becomes notice sigmoid function transforms output range 0 1 this behavior captured log function a classification predictor visualized drawing boundary line barrier prediction changes yes prediction greater 0 5 prediction less 0 5 with well designed system cookie data generate classification boundary looks like now machine knows thing two cookies an introduction neural networks neural networks well suited machine learning problems number inputs gigantic the computational cost handling problem overwhelming types systems discussed as turns however neural networks effectively tuned using techniques strikingly similar gradient descent principle unsupervised machine learning unsupervised learning typically tasked finding relationships within data there training examples used process instead system given set data tasked finding patterns correlations therein a good example identifying close knit groups friends social network data conclusion we covered much basic theory underlying field machine learning course barely scratched surface keep mind really apply theories contained introduction real life machine learning examples much deeper understanding topics discussed herein necessary there many
